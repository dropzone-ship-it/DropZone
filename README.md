## 🎮 What is Drop Zone?

Drop Zone is a **decentralized file storage dApp** built on the Aptos blockchain using the Shelby network. Upload your files, compete on the leaderboard, earn badges, and enjoy the most satisfying upload experience ever created.

We took boring file uploads and made them **legendary** with:

- 🎊 Confetti explosions on successful uploads
- ✨ Cursor sparkle trails
- 📳 Screen shake effects
- 😄 Personality-packed file reactions
- 🏆 Global leaderboard & achievement badges
- 🎨 Beautiful green-on-black aesthetic

**No more boring uploads. Only vibes.** ✨
